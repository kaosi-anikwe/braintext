Should you charge your phone to 100% (68) -- 22:20
It is not necessary to charge your phone to 100%. In fact, it is recommended to charge your phone to between 80% and 90% to maintain the battery’s health. Charging your phone to 100% all the time can reduce the battery’s capacity over time. Why? (121) -- 22:21
Because lithium-ion batteries degrade over time and as they charge, they form a layer of lithium plating on the anode which can cause the battery’s capacity to decrease. So, it’s best to keep your phone’s battery at the optimal level of 80-90%. So what is the essence of a 100% in the phone when it's harmful to the battery (179) -- 22:21
