summarize the following paragraph in 2 sentences  It was Louis Pasteur who settled the matter of spontaneous generation in 1861 with his “swan neck flask” experiment. Pasteur placed nutrient solutions in flasks, heated their necks in a  flame, and drew them out into a variety of curves. The swan neck flasks that he produced in  this way had necks open to the atmosphere. Pasteur then boiled the solutions for a few minutes  and allowed them to cool. No growth took place even though the contents of the flasks were  exposed to the air. Pasteur pointed out that no growth occurred because dust and germs had  been trapped on the walls of the curved necks. If the necks were broken, growth commenced  immediately. Pasteur had not only resolved the controversy, but had shown how to keep  solutions sterile (239) -- 11:56
