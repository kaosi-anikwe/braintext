A gas is contained in a piston-cylinder assembly. The piston mass and cross-sectional area are denoted _n_ and *A* respectively. The only force acting on the top of the piston is due to atmospheric pressure, P. Assuming the piston moves smoothly across the cylinder and the local acceleration of gravity _g_ is constant, show that the pressure of the gas acting on the bottom of the piston remains constant as gas volume varies. What would cause the gas volume to vary? (250) -- 10:04
